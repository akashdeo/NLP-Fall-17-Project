Flooding delays Asian live cattle exports.
Flooding across the Top End has created major delays in live cattle exports to Asia.
Ships bound for Indonesia are expected to remain anchored in the Port of Darwin until after Easter and the market is expected to swing towards available slaughter cattle.
Steve Ellison from the Northern Territory Live Exporters Association says at least 9,000 cattle are stranded.
"Due to the wet weather at this stage they are having trouble getting them out," he said.
"It will certainly affect saleyard numbers and obviously the movement of cattle wherever.
"The roads are closed, stock camps have got to be able to work to put the cattle in the yards even if the yards were open. So it's a double whammy really.
"[But] the condition of the cattle is excellent, but no it looks like being a boomer season. We'll get the numbers, it's just a case of you have got to be patient.".
Meanwhile the Territory's third biggest town is in recovery mode after last week's flood.
Businesses in Katherine have resumed trading, residents have returned home to assess the damage and the Health Department will begin mosquito spraying today.
Local mango grower Peter Marks says the water is falling away quickly and he does not think the flood will delay this year's flowering.
"Another grower spoke to me the other day and he's got one block on the river," he said.
"He's got a house there and the house is high and dry but he said the water was flowing through the trees, not that deep but he didn't see any great concern with it.
"In fact we find if we have a big wet, we have some sections of the paddock that stay quite wet and they always flower the earliest.
"So they're a weird creature, where none of us have got them worked out too good yet. Pretty amazing.".
North-west of Katherine, residents across the Daly River region are preparing for major flooding within the next two days.
A king tide near the mouth of the Daly River mid-week is also expected to have an impact.


Residents warned as river continues to rise.
Police are warning the residents of Katherine in the Northern Territory to be prepared to evacuate as the Katherine River continues to rise.
The Katherine River has grown into a mighty brown fast flowing flood today, a flood that has already broken its banks outside of town and is now scant centimetres from doing the same in Katherine itself.
While police are hoping the river will peak shortly at 18.89 metres, there is the continued possibility the river will continue to rise and authorities are warning residents to pack up the essentials and be prepared to hear the evacuations sirens.


Drought forcing cattle evacuations from Channel Country.
One of the nation's largest beef producers says it is moving nearly 1,000 head of cattle out of Queensland's drought-stricken Channel Country every week.
S. Kidman and Co produces beef for markets in Japan, the US and South-East Asia on properties on the Georgina and Diamantina Rivers and Cooper Creek.
Chief executive Greg Campbell says a moderate flood earlier this year was not enough to stop destocking.
"Throughout the Channel Country at the moment we're about 50 to 60 per cent stocked," he said.


N Qld cyclone damage hits prawns, avocado producers.
Flooding is now causing havoc in Queensland between Cairns and Townsville, in the aftermath of cyclone Larry.
Innisfail recorded 289 millimetres of rain in the 24 hours to 9am AEST, with most coastal areas receiving more than 100 millimetres.
The floods have devastated the region's prawn farming industry, which supplies 40 per cent of the Australian market.
Scott Walter from the Australian Prawn Farmers Association says there are huge losses due to flood damage and loss of power.
"Basically we have power to run our freezers where the stock is kept," Mr Walter said.
"We've got power that run aerators in our ponds, which keep the oxygen levels up to a point where the prawns are capable of basically growing and surviving, so if we lose the ability to oxygenate our ponds we'll lose our crops, and if the freezers go down for too long and the seals are broken, the temperatures will drop and we'll have to destroy the stock because it'll no longer be safe for food.".
Cyclone Larry has also devastated avocado plantations on the Atherton Tablelands in far north Queensland, with losses estimated at up to $15 million.
Just last week the region supplied 80 per cent of the Australian crop.
New South Wales grower Gordon Birch says New Zealand imports are likely to fill the shortfall, until other growing regions begin picking fruit.


Fergies flock to flood festival.
The heroic feats of the famous grey Ferguson tractor are being celebrated in the New South Wales town of Wentworth this weekend.
The Festival of the Flood will see 300 fergies of all shapes are sizes attending to commemorate massive floods in 1956.
The fergies will be the stars of the show because they were used to build levee banks to stop the rising floodwater and protect the town.
Fergie enthusiast John Reeves from Geelong will be there and can not wait to catch up with others who share his passion.


Summer fruit industry looks for Govt support.
There are calls for Federal Government support for the summer fruit industry following signals the Taiwanese export market will not reopen in time for next year's harvest.
Exports were suspended late last year because of Taiwanese concerns over a Queensland fruit fly.
Summerfruit Australia's Wayne Boucher fears if exports to Taiwan resume, an extra 10,000 tonnes of stone fruit could flood the domestic market.
"We'd have to say that it is looking highly unlikely that the work that is currently being done will be completed in time for us to get access to the Taiwanese market in time for this season," he said.


Flooded market makes life tough for citrus growers.
Citrus growers say their outlook is going from bad to worse.
Growers says a large crop, a flood of cheap imported juice concentrate and shrinking export markets are preventing many from selling their fruit.
The summer crop is being dumped in southern New South Wales, with growers angry at an offer of $80 a tonne for their fruit.
Frank Battistel from Riverina Citrus says he is not confident about the future.
"I know quite a few properties that have turned off water to their trees, they just can't continue to lose profit every year like that and they need to make a decision to either keep going and lose money or just get out of the industry.".
But citrus growers in the west believe China could be their salvation.
It has taken more than five years for the Chinese to approve Australian fruit imports, which will largely come from the eastern states.
WA orchardist Mark Scott says that will mean less fruit sent west.
"We compete against imports from those states here in WA every day and so that the taking fruit out from their markets will mean less competition here in WA," Mr Scott said.


Highway upgrade to improve flood prone section.
The Federal Government has announced plans to improve road train access between central Australia and Queensland.
A $2 million upgrade will improve a flood prone section of the Plenty Highway, which links Alice Springs to cattle markets in the east.
But there are no plans to seal the road, which some road trains refuse to use.
Central Australian pastoralist Dick Cadzow says it is a good start but more is needed.
"Any improvement that they do to that road is a big help," he said.
"I can give you an instance here, six decks coming down the other day, we could not get over 30 kilometres an hour.

Japanese consul-general helps mark rice crop anniversary.
The Japanese consul general has helped to mark the 100th anniversary of Australia's first rice crop.
Shisei Kaku has unveiled a memorial sign near Swan Hill in north-west Victoria.
He says he is proud to commemorate the time when Japanese farmer Joe Takasuka first planted a crop on flood prone land on the Murray River.


Cyclone recovery expected to take months.
In far north Queensland and the Gulf country, communities are still trying to come to terms with the impact of cyclone Larry.
The community has donated $10 million to help but the recovery will take months, if not years.
Cyclone Larry is said to have cost 4,000 jobs, many of them on farms and there is a concern young people will exodus the region in search of work.
AgForce has expressed concerns that flood affected graziers may not be able to access assistance if it is means-tested because of the increase in property valuations.
The Bundaberg Sugar Company will not open its Mourilyan mill south of Innisfail for this year's cane crush, saying Larry has drastically reduced the harvest forecasts.
Cane will be diverted to other mills and farmers calling for assistance to remove trees and debris from the orchard have been told by cyclone recovery task force coordinator General Peter Cosgrove that the Army will help if they put up a strong enough case.
"I would like those people who are suffering those frustrations and wonder if they can get urgent assistance to refer it to the incident management centre in Innisfail," he said.
Meanwhile cyclone Larry is being blamed for a temporary shortage of fish in Victorian markets.
Peter Clarke from the Lakes Entrance Fishermen's Co-op says there has been rough weather since the cyclone hit Queensland last week.
Mr Clarke says with winds of more than 30 knots, smaller trawlers are staying in port more days a week than usual.


US sugar quota changes mooted.
The US sugar quota program has long been a source of frustration for Australian producers and exporters.
But changes may be in store.
With full implementation of the North American free tree agreement by 2008, US Agriculture Under-Secretary JB Penn says a flood of Mexican sugar could force changes.
"The border, being completely open in 2008, will mean that we will have to modify the program in some way Â we can't continue to operate a supply-control program if you can't control the supply," he said.


Cool reaction to Qld water plan.
The Queensland Government is looking to buy two large cotton properties in the state's south-west to return water to the Murray-Darling Basin.
The buy-up is expected to cost up to $60 million and deliver 58,000 megalitres of water a year over the New South Wales border.
The Federal Government rejected a similar proposal four years ago to purchase the huge Cubbie Station.
Grazier Pot Peterson is among New South Wales landholders who have been critical of the amount of water Queensland irrigators take out of the Condamine-Balonne river system, and says this plan will not be very beneficial.
"I'm not saying that they shouldn't purchase it, but I just think it would be far more beneficial if they purchased something upstream that would have a big affect on us, because really the water virtually stops at Cubbie," he said.
"As we saw in the 2004 flood they did have a big flood at St George but we didn't get any of it here.".
The plan will be out to the Murray-Darling Ministerial Council meeting in Melbourne on Friday.
Meanwhile the Cubbie Group, which runs Cubbie Station, has slammed calls by the New South Wales Government for its water allocation to be reduced.
The station can store 500,000 megalitres of water for its cotton-growing operation, and graziers south of the border complain they are being starved of crucial flood water flows.
But joint managing director John Grabbe says New South Wales should fix up evaporation losses in the Menindee Lakes in the state's west, before attacking Queensland's science-based water allocations.
"Oh get your own house in order, but let's be fair dinkum, not just throw stones at each other, but let's be fair dinkum," he said.
"I mean, water is too valuable a resource to be going up into the air in shallow storage systems. Now we don't do it at Cubbie, and I implore the southern states to seriously look at their storage systems.
Federal Agricultural Minister Peter McGauran says the CSIRO is scare-mongering, with a report calling for bigger environmental flows for the Murray River.
An extra 500 gigalitres has already been committed to the Murray, but the scientific body says up to five times more will be needed to restore the river's health.
Despite criticising that finding, Mr McGauran acknowledges progress has been slow on the Living Murray Initiative, and says the report will be considered.


TV station operator pushes for rural channel.
The operators of a rural community television station say the Federal Government is ignoring requests for a new digital TV station dedicated to rural Australia.
South Australian-based BushVision says in a national survey of 250 people, more than 90 per cent believed rural issues were not covered adequately by mainstream TV networks and almost all supported a dedicated rural channel.
The Federal Government wants digital technology to replace the current analogue network within six years.
BushVision station manager Leon Ashby there is good reasons for a rural channel.
"For many years, our information and our news has either been sensationalised and it puts a picture of rural Australians always whingeing, always got a flood or a fire, or some catastrophe," he said.
"But it doesn't give the overall picture that there's a lot of good things happening.
"We talked about better communications for the bush but television has been left completely out of the picture.".


Imported feed grain expected to ease shortages.
The Federal Government expects the first imports of feed grain for livestock to arrive in Australia in January to ease looming shortages.
More than 40 import applications are being assessed from companies wanting to fill shortfalls caused by the drought.
Biosecurity Australia officers are making the first assessments of wheat, maize and sorghum in the UK, Canada and the UK.
But Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says the imports are not likely to make a major difference in prices.
"It's a question of balance that we have a million cattle in feedlots at present and of course the dairy, pig meat and chicken industries are terribly dependent on grain," he said.
"So for those who are able to produce grain we don't want to suppress their price and in any event I don't think the amounts being able to be imported will amount to a flood.".
Meanwhile the drought has forced South Australian grain marketing company ABB to accept poorer quality grain.
The company has reduced its screenings for malt barley and will accept smaller and less plump grain.
ABB's Lyndon Asser says the move will benefit growers as the company tries to secure more supply.
